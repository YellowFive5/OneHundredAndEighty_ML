# OneHundredAndEighty_ML

Detection, based on machine learning

## Why?

It just so happened, that, because of many reasons, developement of my [OneHundredAndEighty](https://github.com/YellowFive5/OneHundredAndEighty) was on pause for more than half year. And now, with fresh look, I clearly see big problem - detection paradigm.

There are many people, who had stucked with camera setups to start using app. And I feel sorry for everyone, who failed with it.

2 years ago, when I start this project, it was experiment for me. But now, this 4 cams, this all geometry, this primitive triangulation, this white background, this total unstable and right detection rate in 90-95% looks awful for me...

## Modern world needs modern solutions

That's why I want to try ML. The idea is to have 1 camera with general dartboard view. In prepare-game process I need to collect many-many diff-images to create learning data set to learn neural network. Then, using this network, I will be able to get detection results.

I had some consultations with men who use ML on in his work and knows many about - he said it's smart idea and I must succeed with it.

So let's go...

## 1. Some pre-calculations
![Mapping](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42347722/114311826-fc46d700-9af8-11eb-926e-806838f7d4d0.jpg)

This simplyfied map shows how many throws can be done. This is simple-minimum. On all this throws I need minimum one diff image to learn. From this calculations becomes clear, that it's a lot work ahead... too lot.

So, it will be right to start small. I'll try to prepare minimum dataset for 25 and bulls to learn.

## 2. Only one camera

Camera case and mount printed and set.

## 3. DotsMapper
Further calculation process will use synthetic 1300x1300 px drawed dartboard image and POI's with it's coordinates. To collect this coordinates for learning and mapping to diff-image for NN I use [DotsMapper](https://github.com/YellowFive5/OneHundredAndEighty_ML/tree/main/DotsMapper) And that how it goes:

21 bull point and 108 _25 points at all.

All 129 points collected to local SQLite.db

## 4. DiffImagesCollector
![2021-04-17 20_20_28-Window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42347722/115121395-34e42600-9fbb-11eb-98a4-4d2942690718.png)
With [this simple util](https://github.com/YellowFive5/OneHundredAndEighty_ML/tree/main/DiffImagesCollector) I get next point from .db and it shows on projection. So I need to manually stick dart in this point and get capture. Diff images will save in filesystem and .db 

I plan to take some 'clear' diff-captures for each point (maybe 2 or 3) and then some 'dirty-overlapped' captures this way. After that I will have small dataset to try to learn NN.
