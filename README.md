# OneHundredAndEighty_ML

Detection, based on machine learning

## Why?

It just so happened, that, because of many reasons, developement of my [OneHundredAndEighty](https://github.com/YellowFive5/OneHundredAndEighty) was on pause for more than half year. And now, with fresh look, I clearly see big problem - detection paradigm.

There are many people, who had stucked with camera setups to start using app. And I feel sorry for everyone, who failed with it.

2 years ago, when I start this project, it was experiment for me. But now, this 4 cams, this all geometry, this primitive triangulation, this white background, this total unstable and right detection rate in 90-95% looks awful for me...

## Modern world needs modern solutions

That's why I want to try ML. The idea is to have 1 camera with general dartboard view. In prepare-game process I need to collect many-many diff-images to create learning data set to learn neural network. Then, using this network, I will be able to get detection results.

I had some consultations with men who use ML on in his work and knows many about - he said it's smart idea and I must succeed with it.

So, first of all, I need to collect dataset...
